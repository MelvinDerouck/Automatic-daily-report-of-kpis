KPIs & internal operational management dashboards for CHU 

## Project Overview:
This project aims to enhance operational visibility and decision-making at a hospital by developing two dynamic dashboards. 

## Client dashboard
The first dashboard is tailored for client presentations, highlighting KPIs related to maintenance and service requests. 
Utilizes visually appealing charts and graphs to convey complex data in an easily understandable format.

## Internal managment dashboard
The second dashboard serves internal operational management purposes. For example, it will allow technicians to optimize their day by checking pending interventions.

Automated Data Transfer:
Implementation of an automation process using Power Automate for seamless data transfer from a client-provided CSV export via email to a dedicated SharePoint repository.

This workflow automates the transfer of the export file sent daily by the CHU to the CHUMMT contracts mailbox, to the “GO-CHU-MMT” team Sharepoint for the purpose of daily updating of the associated Power BI report :

Power BI Integration:
Connects Power BI to the SharePoint repository, ensuring real-time and accurate data updates for the dashboards.


## Retrospective 
The Vinci teams posted on the CHU website are today fully satisfied with the daily analysis reports they have.

The dashboard for the client is presented during the weekly meeting and allows communication on the different indicators of the week.

The internal management dashboard has made technicians days more fluid and allows operational managers to have a dedicated management interface to facilitate strategies and decision-making.
